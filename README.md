- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @faaatemaNora.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm passionate about cybersecurity, and I'm currently delving into the world of Linux. I'm also gearing up for CompTIA certification and honing my skills in Java and Python.
- ðŸŒ± I'm on a coding journey, and I must admit, it can get a bit lonely. So, I'm on the lookout for like-minded individuals who share the love for technology and want to study or collaborate on projects together.
